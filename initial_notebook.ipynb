When checking out we called for luggage services to come and after waiting 30 minutes I went down and had to ask in person to get someone to come up. I had called for our vehicle to be pulled up when the Bell Desk had said that they would be right up. Once we got down with our luggage the Valet told my wife she needed to move the vehicle as it had been there too long. She let them know that I was in waiting to check out and the said that was no reason and that they would need to repark the vehicle that my kids where in the back. I finally got done checking out and we where able to leave. Will never go back.                                     2\n",

I didn't have much time to plan and was only concerned with getting out of the storm's path. Before staying at the Fairmont, I stayed at two different hotels in Austin. These two were primarily chosen because they were recommended by a close friend of mine. However, after venturing around Austin, a local advised me to stay at the Fairmont hotel. I wasn't opposed because the pricing looked reasonable, and after two days in Austin, I knew exactly where the building was located. (It's huge, and you definitely wouldn’t be able to miss it.)
