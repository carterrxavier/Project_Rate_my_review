Staff interactions overall were great and they made for an all round stay that I thoroughly enjoyed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

I must give special recognition to the staff of the Fulton Bar and Garrison Restaurant; particularly Kaitlyn Erickson, Monet Cantu, Winday RS and most especially Jasline Quiroga.

      "Wonderful Hampton experience for a girl's weekend. All staff we encountered were helpful, pleasant & professional. Hotel was very clean--guest room, breakfast area, gym, lobby bathrooms. That was impressive. Location is a little further from downtown, but it was a convenient location for what we needed. Look forward to returning the next time I travel to Austin & to enjoy some time relaxing in the outdoor pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Since any travel brings occasional mishap, I prefer to judge a hotel on how it handles issues rather than assume there will never be any. At a recent four day stay here we had an unfortunate encounter the first night that was resolved quickly and professionally with genuine concern. This is a beautiful location and we received great service from the front desk, the valet parking, the shuttle, and especially James in the Library - his attention to detail after only meeting very briefly the first night was exceptional. We shall return.                                                                                           1\n",

      "This hotel is a gem. It’s so unique but right in the heart of so many great Austin spots. It’s walking distance to lady bird lake trail. Great food nearby, Walton Fancy and Staple is across the street. Also the food the hotel makes is delicious ! The avocado, arugula flat bread was spectacular. The pool is absolutely lovely, the gym has 2 cycling bikes, a ton of weights and box jumps. Owen is wonderful and so accommodating, he makes you feel truly special and takes over to top care of the guest. Kara is also very quick in answering questions, and making the stay more enjoyable. Overall 11 out 10 and I highly recommend.    1\n",

I swear those two ladies never stopped helping guests and honestly I thought they were upper management my whole stay until neither name was on the business card!
