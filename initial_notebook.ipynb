      "We upgraded our room to the adult only floor which came with some nice amenities. We reserved a cabana at the adult pool and we received excellent service from our wait staff. We used the concierge who created a wine tasting itinerary which was amazing. We ate at two of the restaurants, we had good food and great service. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this resort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
      "Our group of 15 children, babies and adults visited La Cantera August 1-3, 2021. We had multiple rooms and suites in the Villas. On my last night there I got 60-80 bedbug bites and have some very disgusting photos for proof. I have never had a reaction to any kind of bug bites before. It took 17 days before I could stop using medication. My email and phone calls to La Cantera were never returned.

      "This hotel is clean and friendly, but has two major issues. It’s by a deafeningly loud night club. On Saturday night, the music blasted until 3 AM. The street was full of roaming, rowdy, raucous, raunchy revelers from the club. The club was quiet on Sunday night. I won’t rate this hotel less because of this because it’s out of their control. Other reviewers mention that the front desk will give out earplugs upon request, but I was unaware of this, and would have been uninterested in this even if I had known. The only onsite parking option is $27 a night valet parking. Self-parking is not offered onsite. This is unreasonable and unexpected. It’s very uncharacteristic of the Fairfield Inn chain, or any hotel for that matter. This needs to be obviously stated in the information…    1\n",
